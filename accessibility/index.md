# Accessibility

### Apple Documentation Overview

Accessibility features help a wide range of people interact with their devices. For many, accessibility is a necessity. For others, itâ€™s a practicality. For example, closed captions can be necessary for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, but also useful for someone watching a video in a noisy environment.
