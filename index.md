# Swift Mentorship Program

## Description

This is a readMe designed to keep track of the topics that I am investigating and documenting as part of the Swift Mentorship Program, hosted by the [Swift community](swift.org). 

My mentor is [Shyamal Chandra](https://github.com/shyamalschandra).

The project we will build together is a super hero one! It will use a [public Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com) to build out an iOS Application using `SwiftUI`.

From there - we will dive into ways to make our application more `Accessible` using Apples Accessibility frameworks.

Thirdly, we will attempt to use the `Sourcery` framework to clean up some of our code and generate automated models that will contain the data for our application.

Finally, we will conclude with building our own server-side implmentation in Swift, using the `Vapor` framework. This server-side will make a request to Marvel for us, and give us more control over error handling. It will be the "middle tier" between our app and its ultimate data source.

Without further ado, lets dive in!
