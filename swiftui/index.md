# SwiftUI

### Apple Documentation Overview

SwiftUI provides views, controls, and layout structures for declaring your app’s user interface. The framework provides event handlers for delivering taps, gestures, and other types of input to your app, and tools to manage the flow of data from your app’s models down to the views and controls that users will see and interact with.

There's no doubt this is the future of iOS Development. So, lets spend some time using it in a project. 

Now, I don't know about you, but I am huge Marvel fan! So - lets use a [public Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com) to build out an application in SwiftUI!

The goal will be to let a user select a team of 5 heroes, and fight against 5 that the "computer" selects. For the initial pass - the battle will just be random. Some improvement may come later!
